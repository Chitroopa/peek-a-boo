      <p class="text">Horses are majestic four legged creatures that have been domesticated by humans to help with tasks such as farming, transportation, leisure, wars and sports. They can range from 4.7-6 feet and can weigh anywhere between 840-2200lbs. They are also great runners and can reach speeds of 30mph. They can live for up to around 30 years. A horse's favorite lunch (and dinner, and breakfast) is nothing other than good ol' grass! </p>

      <h5 class="polar1">Click to Learn About Polar Bears</h5>
      <p class="text1">The polar bear is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. They can sprint at speeds close to 25mph. Adult male polar bears can weigh up to 990lbs. Some polar bears have been seen swimming hundreds of miles from land-though they probably cover most of that distance by floating on sheets of ice.</p>
